# Identifying and Analyzing NIDS/HIDS Alerts

## Overview

This assignment focuses on applying **Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)** and **Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)** to detect, analyze, and manage potential security threats. It involves capturing network traffic, generating alerts for suspicious activities, and managing cases to resolve detected issues using tools like **Wireshark**, **Nmap**, and **Security Onion**.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Traffic Capture and Threat Simulation
- **Purpose**: Simulate real-world network activity and potential threats like unauthorized scans or malicious activity.
- **Tools Used**: Wireshark (packet capture) and Nmap (network scanning).
- **Process**:
  - Perform network scans using Nmap to simulate activities like fast and detailed scans.
  - Capture the traffic in Wireshark and save it as a `.pcap` file for further analysis.

### 2. Traffic Analysis with Security Onion
- **Purpose**: Analyze the captured traffic using a centralized IDS to generate actionable alerts.
- **Tools Used**: Security Onion for alert generation and investigation.
- **Process**:
  - Import the `.pcap` file into Security Onion.
  - Review alerts generated by rules like `ET SCAN Possible Nmap User-Agent Observed`.
  - Drill down into alert details (e.g., source IP, destination IP, protocols, severity).

### 3. Alert Escalation and Case Management
- **Purpose**: Simulate an incident response workflow by escalating alerts into cases for further investigation and resolution.
- **Tools Used**: Case management tools in Security Onion.
- **Process**:
  - Escalate alerts indicating suspicious or malicious activity.
  - Add observables, such as:
    - **Type**: `IP`
    - **Value**: Suspicious IP (e.g., `203.0.113.2`).
    - **Description**: Details of the potential threat (e.g., "Possible malicious external IP or penetration testing activity").
  - Assign cases to team members, track progress, and log actions taken.

### 4. Resolution and Documentation
- **Purpose**: Finalize the incident response by documenting findings, adding notes, and closing cases.
- **Process**:
  - Confirm the nature of the threat (e.g., determine if it was benign or malicious).
  - Add logs and comments to the case for future reference.
  - Close the case and mark it as resolved.

## Tools and Techniques Used

1. **Wireshark**:
   - Captures live network traffic.
   - Saves traffic data as `.pcap` files for offline analysis.

2. **Nmap**:
   - Simulates network activities like scans and vulnerability enumeration.
   - Generates network traffic to trigger IDS alerts.

3. **Security Onion**:
   - Detects and analyzes traffic using predefined detection rules.
   - Facilitates alert review, case management, and threat investigation.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Traffic Analysis**:
   - Understand how network activities generate traffic patterns.
   - Identify how malicious activities, such as scans or exploits, appear in packet captures.

2. **Intrusion Detection**:
   - Gain hands-on experience with NIDS/HIDS tools to detect suspicious activities.
   - Learn how detection rules are triggered by specific network behaviors.

3. **Case Management**:
   - Practice documenting and managing security incidents with observables and notes.
   - Learn to escalate alerts and track their resolution through a structured workflow.

4. **Threat Investigation**:
   - Analyze alerts, review packet captures, and correlate findings to potential threats.
   - Develop skills to identify and address the root cause of alerts.

## Real-World Relevance

This assignment simulates a typical **Security Operations Center (SOC)** workflow:
1. **Traffic Capture**: Mimics how SOC teams monitor network traffic in real-time.
2. **Threat Detection**: Reflects how alerts are generated and analyzed in enterprise environments.
3. **Incident Response**: Models the process of escalating and resolving security incidents.

By completing this assignment, you gain foundational skills in **network security**, **incident analysis**, and **response workflows**, which are essential for roles like **SOC Analyst**, **Cybersecurity Engineer**, or **Penetration Tester**.
